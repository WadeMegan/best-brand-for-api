/* 1) This is constant time because regardless of the number of people in the room, it will always take the same amount of time to get a response. This is because you are just yelling to every single person at the same time. */

/* 2) This is linear time because the time it takes you is directly proportional to the number of people in the room. This is under the assumption that it takes you the same amount of time to talk to each person. */
